Reinforcement Learning:
i. Plan of Attack:
ii. Belman equation - State --> s - Action --> a - Reward --> R - Disount --> Y

            PAPER: Theory oof Dynamic equation, RICHARD BELLMAN

            equation : V(s) = max (R(s,a) + YV(s`))

    iii. Markov decision process
        Types
        i. Deterministic Search ( no randomness)
        ii. Non-Deterministic Search ( includes randomness)

            Markov Process
                A stochastic( random distribution) process has the markov property if the conditional probability distribution of future states of the process ( conditional on bot past and present states ) depends only upon the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. A process with this property is called a Markov process.

            Markov Decision Process
                provides a mathematical framework for modelling decision making insituations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.

                V(s) = max (R(s,a) + yΕP(s,a,s`)V(s`))

    iv. Q-learning Intuition

       - Quality of the actions --> Q(s, a)
       - equation: Q(s, a) = R(s,a) + yΕP(s,a,s`)Q(s`, a`)
       - Temporal difference: The heart of Q-learning
